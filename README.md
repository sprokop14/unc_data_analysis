# UNC School System Data Analyzer

This project employs Python to extract and analyze data from the University of North Carolina School System, encompassing all 16 universities. Utilizing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the analysis integrates several powerful libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for data visualization, nltk for natural language processing, and streamlit for interactive web applications. The data is sourced from a published CSV file, ensuring a robust and comprehensive analysis of the university system.
